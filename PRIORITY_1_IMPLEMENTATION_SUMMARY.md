## 🏦 Broker-Specific Enhancements for Vantage RAW

- **Commission-aware position sizing**: Lot sizing now subtracts the round-turn commission per symbol so risk stays aligned with ATR targets even on RAW pricing.
- **Spread and execution telemetry**: Every scan captures spread snapshots, spread/ATR ratios, and the resolved MT5 fill mode to spot widening spreads or slippage in real time.
- **Broker-compliant stop management**: Breakeven, trailing, and partial-stop updates now respect `trade_stops_level`, `trade_stops_step`, and `trade_freeze_level`, preventing rejected modifications on Vantage RAW accounts.
- **Symbol overrides ready**: Per-symbol commission mappings make it easy to adapt when the broker adjusts fees.

## ✅ Next Test Plan

1. **Dry-run backtest replay**
  - Confirm ATR sizing minus commissions still risks ≤ target percentage.
  - Verify trailing/breakeven updates land outside broker stop levels.
2. **Demo account smoke test (Vantage RAW)**
  - Run the live loop for a full session; capture spread telemetry and ensure no `TRADE_RETCODE_INVALID_STOPS` errors.
  - Validate partial closures trigger at 1:1 R:R with commission-adjusted lots.
3. **Log review & telemetry audit**
  - Inspect new spread and fill-mode logs for each fill; flag symbols consistently > 1.5× ATR spread.
  - Update commission overrides if deltas are spotted in the log snapshots.
4. **Go/No-Go checklist before production**
  - Confirm strategy performance tracker still persists metrics.
  - Ensure risk guard thresholds (soft/hard) remain untouched and trigger as expected in logs.

**Status: PRIORITY 1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** ✅

## 📲 Telegram Remote Control (New)

### Setup

1. **Create bot token** with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and keep it secret.
2. Place credentials either in environment variables **before** launching the bot:

   - `ULTIMA_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `ULTIMA_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS` (comma-separated numeric IDs; e.g. `6401257809`)

   or create `telegram_settings.json` (see `telegram_settings.example.json`) in the repo root or inside `live/`:

   ```json
   {
     "bot_token": "123456789:REPLACE_WITH_REAL_TOKEN",
     "allowed_user_ids": [6401257809]
   }
   ```

3. **Whitelist matters**: the bot ignores any Telegram user not in `allowed_user_ids`, preventing strangers from issuing commands.

### Available commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/pause [reason]` | Immediately pauses new trade entries and notes the optional reason. |
| `/resume` | Resumes normal trading. |
| `/performance` | Sends balance, equity, margin usage, guard states, open-position summary, and run-state info. |
| `/risk <low | medium | high | status>` | Switch between predefined risk tiers or show the current settings. |
| `/help` | Shows the quick reference table above. |

### Risk presets

| Preset | Account risk / trade | Risk multiplier cap | Soft guard limit | Margin block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **low** | 8% | x2.6 | 28% | 72% |
| **medium** | 12% | x3.5 | 33% | 78% |
| **high** | 16% | x4.2 | 38% | 82% |

Switching presets also nudges soft/margin guard alert/resume thresholds so the bot aligns with the chosen aggressiveness. After any change, the command reply confirms the active preset and key risk numbers.

### Pause/resume safeguards

- Live loop checks for Telegram commands every scan and while paused.
- When paused, the bot idles (no symbol scans) but still reports `/performance` and accepts `/risk` adjustments.
- All pause/resume transitions are logged to console and mirrored to Telegram.
